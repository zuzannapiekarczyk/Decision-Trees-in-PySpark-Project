# Decision-Trees-in-PySpark-Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging decision trees in PySpark for both classification and regression tasks. The project is divided into two main parts:

### Theoretical Section:

- **Introduction to Decision Trees:**
  Understanding the principles of decision trees, their partitioning, operational methods, advantages, and limitations.

### Practical Section:

#### a. Classification Trees:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Iris Dataset:**
   - Perform EDA on the Iris dataset, including visualizations, correlation maps, and dataset splitting into training and testing sets.

2. **Classification Tree Model:**
   - Create a decision tree classification model using PySpark.
   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
   - Assess the model using precision, accuracy, confusion matrix metrics.
   - Visualize the decision tree's predictions.

#### b. Regression Trees:

1. **Random Number Dataset Generation:**
   - Generate a dataset of random numbers for regression purposes.
   - Conduct EDA on the generated dataset, including visualizations, and dataset splitting into training and testing sets.

2. **Regression Tree Model:**
   - Develop a decision tree regression model using PySpark.
   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set.
   - Assess the model using precision, accuracy, confusion matrix metrics.
   - Visualize the decision tree's predictions.

Feel free to explore the code, adapt it to different datasets, and experiment with various decision tree parameters to enhance model performance. Happy exploring!
